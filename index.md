# Booking System Project using cloud services & Cal.com

Hi! Welcome to my project where I build a booking system prototype based on the open-source Cal.com app — using Microsoft Azure.

This project servers two purposes: the first one is for my schoolproject (slutprojekt till kursen i molnteknologier), and the second one is for my teaching job (lärare-vårdnadhavaras samtal)

---

## Project Overview

The goal is to create a scalable, secure, and cost-effective booking platform that can be used in real life — for example, allowing parents to book meeting times with teachers.

This project covers:

- Designing the cloud architecture with Azure services  
- Running Cal.com in containers  
- Comparing Azure with AWS  
- Optimizing performance and cost  
- Reflecting on what I learned along the way
